This is a project created by Matthew Ursaki and myself for our Database Management Systems class. The code was created with Google Colab to easily use tensorflow and work with co-owned google drives.

The dataset can be easily changed with any directory with spectrograms separated into like genres by replacing the directory path. Test path can be any folder that has spectrograms in it and it will summarize what the highest amount of spectrograms were classified as.
